	            <p class="about-blue-text">TopDish is a new resource for urban diners that simplifies discovery for dishes and restaurants. The site collects your preferences, data from restaurants and ratings from other diners to offer personalized recommendations. <br />
<br />
Using the site is also the simplest way for people with dietary needs or restrictions, like vegetarians or those with Celiac's Disease, to find varied, interesting cuisine that fits their lifestyle in their city. <br />
<br />
We work closely with restaurants to ensure dishes are accurately represented and to provide them with feedback that gets down to a culinary level, all designed to help them better answer the needs of their dining public.</p>
